# cpp-init

An interactive command line tool for creating new CMake-based C++ projects quickly and effortlessly.
This is only meant for personal use, but feel free to take it if you need it.

This tool is able to:
- Create blank project templates for executables, header-only or compiled libraries.
- Set up vcpkg manifest/registry settings.
- Set up project settings like warnings for the three main C++ compilers.
- Generate dll-related macros for libraries.
- Create blank templates for Breathe (Doxygen & Sphinx)-based documentation.
